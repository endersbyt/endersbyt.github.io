			<h2>WEBSITE SUMMARY</h2>
			<p>This website is a personal portfolio website mainly to show off my photo and media skills. It's designed to be a place where I can direct people interested in my work to see what types of things I've done in the past, and hopefully entice them to contact me for video or photography work. I've been wanting to make a site like this for a while and the project was the perfect time to get started. At the completion of this course, I plan to spend more time polishing it over winter break and eventually publish it to its own domain name on the web.</p>
			<p>My favorite part of this site is the <a href="../index.html">Home page.</a> As this is a media portfolio, I knew that the homepage had to be a big splash of media to pull people in. When I finally got the background video working, I was excited to see how well it came out, using shots from my demo reel as the backdrop. I also really liked the <a href="../photography.html">Photography page,</a> and its rollover effect on the 2 options. I also feel like the <a href="../photography/places.html">Places</a> and <a href="../photography/people.html">People</a> pages are also really good as their simple layout really makes the photos pop, and their adaptive layout make them look good on any device.</p>
			<p>I feel that my <a href="../video.html">Video page</a> and my <a href="../about.html">About Me</a> pages could use some work. The design of the <a href="../video.html">Video page</a> doesn’t make the videos pop much, making it easy to glance past them. The <a href="../about.html">About Me</a> page is also nothing special. It presents all the information, but not in an exciting way like the rest of the site</p>

			<h2>MEDIA</h2>
			<p>All the video and photo media (except for the gear page) was created by me. Photos were edited in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, videos were edited in Adobe Premiere and After Effects.</p>
			<p>Embeded Media can be found on the <a href="../video.html">Video page.</a></p>
			<p>The images with rollover effects can be found on the <a href="../photography.html">Photography</a> page</p>

			<h2>BORROWED CODE</h2>
			<p>Code for the background video (epecialy the CSS for it) on the home page was based off of <a href="http://slicejack.com/fullscreen-html5-video-background-css/">this site.</a></p>
			<p>Javascript/jQuery code was made using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/">W3 schools</a> and some help from my roomate.</p>
