				<h2>ABOUT TIM</h2>
				<p>Tim is a self-taught hobby photographer, videographer, and graphic animator. He started out producing content for his home church, eventually rising to become the Creative Media director at Friendship Baptist Church. He works to produce weekly announcement videos, along with videos for every almost ministry and event to promote them to attendees and volunteers. In his 4 years of work, he has created over 300 videos played during Sunday services and uploaded to their Facebook Page and website. He took what he learned there and expanded to making videos for other churches and college ministries as well.</p>
				<p>As a climbing camp counselor at Eagle Rock Day Camp, Tim started to help in the media department, taking over the video production and becoming their photo editor. He recorded and edited 15 videos for use in online advertisement in his free time at camp.</p>
				<p>As Tim got more into media, he began to experiment more with photography, spending time driving around and finding the best nature spots, and self-teaching the art of photography. Through college he started to take more photos of his friends and learning how to work with people.</p>
