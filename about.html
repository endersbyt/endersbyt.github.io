								<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
								<p>From a young age, I've always loved playing around with cameras. As a kid, my dream was to one day have my own green screen. As High school started, I started to take media more seriously.</p>
								<p>My first media position was the Creative Media Director at my church. There I just started making videos for almost everything. Weekly announcements videos, Ministry spotlights, fun little skits. From there, I started making videos for multiple churches, and then I went on to take over media at Eagle Rock Day Camp.</p>
								<p>As I started to work with my camera more, I fell in love with photography. Driving all over in my free time just to find great nature shots. As I went through college, I started to focus on photographing people as well, getting my friends together to go take photos in my favorite nature spots.</p>
